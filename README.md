# Sential-host
Sential-host is an EDR style, local, open-source security agent for linux systems. we are only at our first commit. its pretty solid.

it stays between the user networking and the kernel and reviews if your traffic makes sense. if it doesnt. it shuts it down. prevents cyberattacks as they happen.

# I focused on.
- network visibility
- early detection of commodity malware and abuse
- behavioural detection
- not fucking your laptop.

# Threat model.
This protects you from skids and hackers. its not going to stop full government survailence but it works for evading some black hats.
